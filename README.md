# Mushroom images dataset
A collection of JPG images of mushrooms of the Northeast Univted States.
Inteneded to be used for image classification in deep learning

The data images are divided into folders representing the species category which can serve as a ground truth label.
Note that early versions of this dataset class the images by the keywords under which they were scraped from the web.
Later and future versions will be culled and inappropriately classed images either reclassed or removed to improve the accuracy of the set.
